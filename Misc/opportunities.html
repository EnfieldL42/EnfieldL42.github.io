<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>


</ul><p>Since Machine Learning and AI are a fast data driven businesses. So what are some of the opportunities that Machine learning can give us.</p>
<p>Well, detecting emotions give us multiple applications for technology. A machine that can learn facial expressions and voice tones that adapt to a persons emotions is very valuable as it is able to customize itself to archive better results when working with someone and archive a more natural way to interact with us.</p> 
<p>Of course a massive part that Machine Learning in AI can do is help us with our own professions, this is rather a controversial topic as we don’t want machines to do all the work for us but being able to do massive boring workloads and paperwork, a machine would be able to do it in our stead leaving us free to make more productive work much more efficiently and leaving the work that a AI currently has more difficulties towards for us such as exercising judgement, decision-making, and client entertainment.</p>
<p>Next opportunity would be health care, AI would be able to analyse data to to reduce the risk, by finding better targets for development, this means it would be able to diagnose someone and deliver healthcare assistance.</p>
<p>Lastly, currently we search things on the internet quite frequently, we currently have algorithms that will help us search for what is more relevant to us, Machine Learning in AI will be able to further improve our searches, for example using data it will find more relevant sites whether we are searching for information or searching for entertainment, it will be able to know your tastes and how smart you so that you won’t get information that you do not understand or it will give you very in depth hypothesis.</p>
