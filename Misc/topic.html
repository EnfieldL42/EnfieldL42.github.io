<h1>Chosen Technology/Topic</h1>

<p>We decided to choose Machine Learning in AI as our technology/topic as Machine Learning is a very important and relevant factor within the society today and the upcoming foreseeable future. We see Machine Learning as having a very positive impact on the society today when it comes to education, research and businesses however, even though Machine Learning can bring some negatives within the society but in a long term process it is beneficial. Machine Learning brings and provides a real time prediction, insight, data and the power of computers to help people. For example, AIâ€™s goal is to help people as much as possible so when machine learning takes old or previous data from its past experience, it programmes itself to better and enhance its capabilities which is beneficial for society. Why must you ask? Well machine learning bring help towards education, business, and even healthcare where doctors or professionals are able to use technology that diagnose their patients moore faster and more accurately, that tend to also help develop treatments and medical resources to provide the needs of their patients and reduce the risk of medical and diagnostic errors that can be serious. Another example or a positive, Machine learning in AI provides technology and resources for students and teachers within schools to implement their use for researching and learning new things. Machine learning has been very beneficial within 2020 and 2021 as covid-19 being a global issue, machine learning in AI has provided students and teachers to communicate online for example, zoom calls to continue their classes online and without class-rooms. This has been beneficial for most students. Some are able to focus better on an online class rather than in class, however there are some students and teachers that prefer being taught in a physical class. </p>
<p>Machine learning is a significant factor; its importance within the society is to provide the people with resources online, while AI is taking previous data, experiences and implementing instructions to better itself therefore, it provides people better experience and resources. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it for itself to mimic or enhance without explicitly programming. Machine learning is a huge factor when it comes to the business environment as machine learning tools and resources provide and enable the business organisation to move quickly and stay up when it comes to competing with their competitors for example, SpaceX and Nasa. Machine Learning tends to drive business results, which can have a positive or negative impact as it is unpredictable however AI tries to make sure by using experiences and predicting business markets better than before. </p>
