<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><p>With automation comes many risks, labour specifically is something to be worried about, yes having things automated helps alot with workers however what happens when there is too much automation? Having machines that know how to do your job not only better, with more efficiency and way cheaper, industries are bound to want to replace their workforce with machines which would lead to a massive increase of unemployed people.</p>
<p>The next risk is connected with Machine Learning in the workforce. Now that industries replaced the employees with machines, the unemployed will have difficulties finding a job while the industry will be getting richer with less expenses causing a huge wealth gap.</p>
<p>Next we have the concept of autonomous machines becoming independent from us. Currently I believe we don’t have to worry too much about AI coming to kill us, but eventually AI could have a mind of its own and decide to stop doing what we want it to do, by then we would be heavily dependent on them and this could cause harm to our society and the way we function.</p>
<p>Autonomous machines can be used in very harmful ways, for example they can be used in the military for weapons, missiles and drones. A machine that is able to win a war is very useful to a country, but what happens when the wrong people get their hands on it? It is very hard not to leak technology and the data it uses, so we definitely wouldn’t want terrorists or criminals to have them do whatever they please.</p>
