<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<p>In my opinion, Machine Learning in AI is an incredible way for us as a society to reach the future faster. I believe that eventually most of technology, if not everything will be autonomous. By having machines do our work we will be able to progress faster as a species leading us to new heights and limits, what we now cannot reach does to the imperfections of humans, it will be eventually fixed with AI. Of course this does not only goes to us but other species as well, by having more efficiency we are able to minimize the damage on our environment and animals around us, for example an autonomous machine would be able to perfectly manage farms or factories that produce greenhouse gasses and so make sure we that we do not uselessly waste these gasses that we need, this might be in a small scale as the amount of gas being reduce is small but when seeing in a large scale as all farms and factories have this method of not wasting their resources with the combination of having a long term period this would have a massive impact on your planet and Iâ€™m sure it would be a positive impact. Furthermore Machine Learning in AI will let us focus on other things while they do the work needed, what I mean is that when we want to research and develop something, having artificial intelligence perform the necessary procedures and tests we can then analyse them and focus on the more human side of things which I think would lead to not only on having projects being done faster but also with higher success rates. Although I believe this is the future and it's basically written in stone, I do think having everything being autonomous will be an issue sooner or later, we are an ever growing population that that will eventually need to rely on space exploration for habitable planets, and so we as a population need things to do, what would we do for the length of our lives if anything we can do is replaced by our machines? We will be a completely useless species that heavily relies on our creations which could lead to our downfall. Another negative aspect of machine learning is leaving ethics and morals for them to make life dependent choices. Currently, we do not have the potential of creating AI that supports emotions and is able to think and act according to the rules of our society as well as having a mind of its own having its own values, this means that when creating AI all we can do is pre-set rules and conditions that machine will follow according to the situations, as a result if a life dependent situation happens where it did not learn the procedure for that specific thing it could lead to major disaster and so making it hard for us to fully trust AI to make this judgements that are complex to even us to understand as everyone thinks differently. In conclusion, I think Machine Learning in AI is our future, it's what we will need, however we will lead to problems and we will have to deal with them when progressing with this aspect of technology.</p>
