<h1>COMP501: Machine Learning in AI</h1>


<p>From now and in the upcoming future technology has become important and relevant during now and the future. We believe that Machine Learning in AI is part of our lives and for the foreseeable future, as it affects the way people communicate, learn and think which plays an important role within the society today. Machine learning has great positives but also negatives within society. However, a few positives are that machine learning can have a positive impact on education, businesses, and for competition. Machine learning makes computed used self-learning mode using previous and new data to allow itself where it can be enhanced and better than it was before. An example of a highly enhanced technology when it comes to AI is Tesla, Teslaâ€™s self-driving mode consists of AI that is checking for its surroundings, radar, gps, and other measurement units. This allows the car to drive on its own using Artificial intelligence without having a driver physically move the car.</p>
<p>Machine Learning in AI is also known to be an application of artificial intelligence also known as AI, which provides computers or systems the capability of learning, improving and experiencing. AI tends to learn from its previous data, it tends to adapt and most importantly improve without being programmed by a human. Machine learning in AI is capable of doing a lot of things, whether it's experiencing and learning from its previous data and improving itself to fill in holes that it thinks it's missing, basically like what a human does but programmed on its own. Machine Learning's main focus is on the development of computer programs which can access previous data and present and implement it for AI to learn itself. These could be given by instructions and experiences from the past. However, AI runs on different algorithms that aim to mimic and learn from instructions and previous data, these algorithms are known or considered as sequences in keywords.</p>
<p>These algorithms that are run within the system are basically procedures that run from data to create a machine learning model, to perform and they consider these as pattern recognition which uses certain patterns to learn from its data and research or improve itself. These algorithms are procedures that are used or implemented within a code and run, we can say this is more of a prediction algorithm where the algorithm predicts its next enhancement and what it needs to improve. Algorithms consist of  linear regression, logistic regression, artificial neural networking and decision tree. These are mainly done by coding or programming using math or coding concepts, software developers tend to use these. The use of these algorithms for example, linear regression is used to estimate the real values of numbers and costs.</p>
