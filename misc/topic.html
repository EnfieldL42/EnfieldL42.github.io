<h1>Chosen Technology/Topic</h1>


</ul><h4><p>The topics chosen of machine learning is about the development of computational models. It finds hidden insight in data using methods from the neural networks, statistics, operations analysis, and physics without being specific programmed where to look or what to infer. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables a machine to learn from previous data without having to program it directly. AIâ€™s mission is to create a smart computer system that can solve complicated problems in the same way that humans can. The topics chosen are;
</ul><h5><p>What is Machine learning within AI and the history behind it
</ul><h5><p>Machine Learning (AI) in automation and its impact in society and employability
</ul><h5><p>AI within software eg. Siri, Cortana and Bixby
